#### This flow allows you to convert CSV data automatically (without having to think about the column naming and mapping)

Steps to use the flow :

1. Define the separator you will have in your csv raw data. And edit the "separator" action with the value (by default it's a ";").
2. Grab your data from your source and put it in the "Data2Convert" action as string
3. Use the JSON result from the "Compose - Raw result"
